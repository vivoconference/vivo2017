#### FAQs for poster/demo session

##### What do I need to do to give a Demo?

You will need to bring a laptop with your demo on it.

##### What type of equipment will be provided?

We will provide power cords and table for your laptop.

##### Will there be screens and computers?

No. Your demo will be done using your laptop.

##### What will I need for my poster presentation?

A printed copy of the poster itself. We will provide a board and material to hang your poster.

##### What type and size of poster do I need to make?

Posters will be limited to 35 inches (width) x 35 inches (height).

##### Will I have time to see other demos and posters if my submission is accepted?

Attendees will view and discuss your work during the poster/demo reception. In addition, we are encouraging presenters to hang posters earlier during the day so they can be viewed during breaks.

##### Where can I get my poster printed in NYC?

Attendees will need to make their own arrangements for printing and delivery of their poster. We recommend [Makesigns](http://www.makesigns.com/) where you can place your order online and arrange for the poster to be shipped to your hotel. There is a [FedEx Office Print & Ship Center](http://local.fedex.com/ny/new-york/office-0219/) located at 1122 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10075, about a 20 minute walk from the VIVO 2017 Conference site at Weill Cornell Medicine. You can also print your poster at [Printingmanhattan.com](http://printingmanhattan.com/) which is 10 minutes away from Weill Cornell Medicine.


#### FAQ for session presenters

If there are any “special” needs you might foresee beyond displaying a presentation (e.g.  group discussion, video with sound), please let us know in advance so we can try to accommodate them.
