#### VIVO 2017 Conference

#### Call for Proposals

##### Open through April 2nd, 2017

The Eighth Annual VIVO Conference will be held August 2-4, 2017 at the Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City. The organizers are pleased to issue this call for proposals to the program.
The VIVO Conference creates a unique opportunity for people from around the world to come together to explore ways to use semantic technologies and linked open data to promote scholarly collaboration and research discovery.

The VIVO conference is an excellent opportunity to meet with VIVO team members from participating institutions. The conference offers an open and collaborative environment to share ideas and discuss topics related to adoption and implementation of VIVO, VIVO-based tools and the opportunities created by advancing data sharing and team science.
Authors are invited to submit proposals for panel and paper presentations, workshops, and posters or demos on topics of interest for the Eighth Annual VIVO Conference in August. 

#### Deadlines:

* Proposals must be received by Sunday, April 2nd, 2017 at 12:00 AM EST
* Acceptance Notification: May 15th, 2017 by 12AM EST

#### [Submit your proposal](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vivo17)

Contributions are invited to explore, evaluate, or demonstrate exceptional VIVO implementations, integration with external systems, and experiences on traditional and alternative methods of tracking and presenting impact. We encourage submissions on all aspects of using and/or studying semantic technologies within the interpretive context of representing scholarship and scholars, but especially on the role of communities of collaboration and faceted teamwork across disciplines within this area of scholarly inquiry.
We invite proposals for presentations, posters or demos, submissions for a limited number of opportunities for interactive panel discussions (60 to 90 minutes), and workshops. Proposals are welcome from emerging and experienced students, teachers, developers, professionals, and researchers.

#### Instructions for Submitting Proposals

##### Conference Presentations and Panels
Proposals for presentations or panels should be maximum of 500 words. Abstracts of accepted presentations and panels will be made available through the conference’s website. In general, sessions will have two or three presentations; panels may take an entire session or may be combined with a presentation. Relevant proposals unsuccessful in the main track will be considered for inclusion, as appropriate, as a poster.

##### Posters and Demos

We invite proposals for posters and demos that showcase current work. Proposals for posters and demos should be maximum of 500 words. Attendees will view and discuss your work during the poster/demo reception.
Demos will be held during the poster session.  The person presenting the demo should provide the equipment (typically a laptop).
Please indicate in your submission whether you are proposing a poster or a demo.

##### Workshops

Proposals for the free workshops should also be maximum of 500 words. Workshops will be held on August 2nd and each will be 3.5 hours long or the whole day. We encourage proposals that focus on trending topics relevant to the VIVO community as well as the the broader semantic web community, research information systems, evaluation and impact, transparency in scholarship, open science and open data principles. Please address the following in your workshop proposal:
* Length of session (e.g. half a day or a whole day)
